CNS 2450 - Software Engineering
========

So this is the class repository that we will be using in the Software Engineering course.  This repository will be setup to hold any of the code that is worked on together in class.  This will also hold any sample code or applications that I create to help you on your projects.  

Contributing
-----------

I always love people that help to contribute to the success of a class, and as such I love people that help to contribute to this repository by fixing the (I'm sure) many mistakes that will show up.  The contribution progress is for you to create a "fork" of this repository, make the necessary changes to fix the issue in the fork, and then to submit a "pull request" so that I can review the changes.  To give some incentive, there will also be some bonus points given to you at the end of the semester by the contributions that you have worked on.
