Tyler, hi.  Just checking in on the UI work.  When do you expect we'll have some wire frames we can review together?
 
Thanks,

Hi there gentlemen!

Yes, an update. I am working on putting together some new wireframes laying out the new teacher profile pages.

What do you guys think? Feedback?

Thanks,
